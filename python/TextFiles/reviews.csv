some movie reviews
My favorite movie is Rush Hour. The film was launched in 1998 and the genre of this film is Action, Comedy. The film is about two police officers who are completely different in character and manner of working, who are investigating a case at the level of national importance. I like this film because of the mood and tone, it helps to understand the meaning of friendship.
My favorite film is Stranger Things. The movie was launched in 2016 and a genre of this film is sci-fi. The movie is about a group of boys that have to find the truth and protect the city from a monster. I like this movie because of the mood and tone, it seems like American in the old days.
